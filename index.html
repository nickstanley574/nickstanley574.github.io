<h2>Greetings ðŸ‘‹</h2>
<p>
    I'm Nick and I'm a Software Engineer that accidentally found my way into software operations right when DevOps concepts were gaining momentum and industry wide adoption. I have seen DevOps philosophies succeeded/fail and have already been in tech long
    enough to see a new kid on the block emerged called SRE.

    The primary goal of this site is for me to be a better writer. I believe the only way to learn or improve a skill is to try, fail, learn, and repeat. Keeping that in mind and embracing Adam Savage's quote <i>"Failure is always an option"</i>,
    let the learning commence. I hope a side effect my personal improvements project is others find my content interesting and worth sharing with others.
