  <h1>Water Sensors: The Smartest Home Device</h1>
<div class="post-date">

<p>The Internet-of-Things is here, light bulbs, thermostats, outlets, microwaves, fridges, dishwashers, meat thermometers, grills and much more is “smart” now. As I see it, most smart devices add complexity to life and do not make life easier. I subscribe to the idea that; <strong>My possessions should serve me. I should not serve them.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Spend time updating firmware on light bulbs…nope.</li>
  <li>Thermostat “Smart” Schedule…an analog schedule is fine.</li>
  <li>Cooking Thermometer…get up every 10 min and check an analog one.</li>
  <li>A Grill…see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/r3o76m/sending_forced_software_updates_to_a_grill_on_a/">Reddit - Software Updates a Traeger Grill on a Thanksgiving</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the hassle factor, there are privacy and security concerns that lead me to avoid IoT devices. That said, the exception I have made is for my “smart” water sensors. The brand I use consists of a central hub and many individual sensors. The app provides an option to receive email alerts. Using my personal Pagerduty account I provided the app with the Pagerduty email to allow both myself and my partner get alerts.</p>

<p>A little over a year after I setup the sensors, my partner and I were woken up a Pagerduty alert at 2 in the morning. That was the moment the hot water hose under our kitchen sink decided to fail. My guess is the water was going for no more than 2 minutes before the alarm triggered, and in that time 2 to 4 gallons of water got on the kitchen floor. If we stayed asleep we would have easily woken up to an disaster.</p>

<p>Smart water sensors are worth every penny and every minute I need to maintain them by updating firmware, testing them and changing their batteries. They have paid for themselves and are one of the few IoT devices on my home network.</p>
