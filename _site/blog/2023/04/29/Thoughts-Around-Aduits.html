<blockquote>
  <p>SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls 2) is an auditing framework that is used to evaluate the effectiveness of a service organization’s internal controls over security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. It is a type of audit report that assesses the controls at a service organization that are relevant to the security, availability, and confidentiality of the data processed by that organization on behalf of its clients CHATGPT.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Audits are - by necessity(1) - value judgements (otherwise we’d call them “proofs”). This audit concerned the source code. I very much want a source code audit to make value judgements about the audited source code. That is its entire reason for existing, after all (1) audits involve examination and possibly testing. Neither of these can offer guarantees beyond “what we observed, is there / happened. – HACKER NEW “</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The NGER Audit Determination’s definition of a reasonable assurance engagement is as follows: ‘A reasonable assurance engagement means an assurance engagement in which the audit team leader gives an opinion, expressed as a reasonable assurance conclusion, if appropriate in the circumstances of the engagement https://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/Infohub/Audits/Pages/Forms%20and%20resources/Audit%20determination%20handbook/Levels-of-assurance-explained.aspx’.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, just like it is impossible to prove that there is no bug in a software system, it is also impossible to prove that a business process is fully compliant. Audits are, therefore, value judgments based on the evidence available at the time of the audit.</p>

<p>What do audits really give</p>
<ul>
  <li>1 person cannot destroy a business</li>
  <li>If someone does do something that could arm a bussines it is clear it was done mulially becuase it got past the controls.</li>
  <li>Puts more reasonability on the employees then the bussiness.
    <ul>
      <li>This is not a bad thing</li>
      <li>If there is a outage that was caused becuaJust
se someone was able to push directly to production.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
