# Title Ideas
* Decisions add up exponentiale
* A penny saved is not a penny earned ... is more. 
* Tech debt is not simple interest but compounded interest.

# Main ideas 

Everything is a currency of time. Time is the only this we trade in life, just how varies.

"Often why I have been in meeting regarding design decisions and approaches there are conversations around doing thing the ?right? way or moving quickly to accepting the tech debt that will be fixed later. 

Simple example:
Doing things the right way: 24hr
Doing this fast (tech debt): 12hr
Tech Debt time: 12hrs
