title: Is ChatGPT a Evil Wizard?
---


The other day, I was reviewing my book notes from "The Pragmatic Programmer," and came across the following excerpt from the "Evil Wizards" section.   

> Tool makers and infrastructure vendors have come up with a magic bullet, the wizard. Wizards are great. Just click a single button, answer a couple of simple questions, and the wizard will automatically generate skeleton code for you.

Keep in mind that when the book was written the term "wizard" was used to describe a software the would help a user threw step to complete a task. In the excerpt it saying that a Wizard could be use to auto generate code for a project saving the developer time. This kinda sounds like the recent media storm about ChatGPT and AI and with that in mind here is the full section on "Wizards" however I have add "[AI]" for next to .

All the time the applications themselves are getting more complex. Most developments now use a multitier model, possibly with some middleware layer or a transaction monitor. These programs are expected to be dynamic and flexible, and to interoperate with applications written by third parties.

Oh, and did we mention that we needed it all next week?

Developers are struggling to keep up. If we were using the same kind of tools that produced the basic dumb-terminal applications 20 years ago, we’d never get anything done.

So the tool makers and infrastructure vendors have come up with a magic bullet, the wizard **[AI]**. Wizards **[AIs]** are great. Do you need an MDI application with OLE container support? Just click a single button, answer a couple of simple questions, and the wizard **[AI]** will automatically generate skeleton code for you. The Microsoft Visual C++ environment creates over 1,200 lines of code for this scenario, automatically. **[AIs]** Wizards are hard at work in other contexts, too. You can use **[AIs]** wizards to create server components, implement Java beans, and handle network interfaces all complex areas where it’s nice to have expert help.

But using a **[AI]** wizard designed by a guru does not automatically make Joe developer equally expert. Joe can feel pretty good—he’s just produced a mass of code and a pretty spiffy-looking program. He just adds in the specific application functionality and it’s ready to ship. But unless Joe actually understands the code that has been produced on his behalf, he’s fooling himself. He’s programming by coincidence. 

Wizards **[AI]** are a one-way street—they cut the code for you, and then move on. If the code they produce isn’t quite right, or if circumstances change and you need to adapt the code, you’re on your own.

Sound failure doesn't it.

The only part of that section that as change is "Wizards **[AI]** are a one-way street—they cut the code for you, and then move on. If the code they produce isn’t quite right, or if circumstances change and you need to adapt the code, you’re on your own."

Maybe this will age like milk. Maybe 80% if all coding positions will go way. Maybe

"What are evil wizards in as mentioned in The pragmatic programmer? 


"The Pragmatic Programmer" book, first published in 1999, the term "evil wizard" was used to describe developers who wrote obscure, overly complex code that was difficult to understand and maintain. The book warned against becoming an "evil wizard" and instead advocated for writing clean, understandable code that would be easy for others to work with.

According to the book, "evil wizardry" is characterized by code that is overly clever, difficult to read, and hard to modify. Such code can be a major obstacle to maintenance and can cause significant problems down the line.

The authors of "The Pragmatic Programmer" urged developers to avoid "evil wizardry" by focusing on simplicity, clarity, and maintainability in their code. They recommended using simple solutions to complex problems, writing code that is easy to read and understand, and avoiding overly clever or obscure programming techniques.

In short, the term "evil wizard" in "The Pragmatic Programmer" refers to developers who write unnecessarily complex and difficult-to-maintain code, rather than skilled and experienced software developers as I previously described.

DO JUST COPY AND PASTE. 

Yes, copying and pasting is something we should do to save time for quick tasks. For log live application and processes we should NOT copy and paste code we do not understand. Instead, we should type it out ourselves. We should not be using code we do not understand. By not copying and pasting typing it out we grow to understand what the code is doing and possible modifications and improvements for our use case.
