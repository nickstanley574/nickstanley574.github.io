> *"Continuous Delivery is the ability to get changes of all types – including new features, configuration changes, bug fixes, and experiments – into production, or into the hands of the users, safely, and quickly in a sustainable way."*  
> — **Jez Humble**


The most important word in Jez’s description of Continuous Delivery is **sustainable**.  

In my experience, many teams interpret this definition in the order it’s written:  

1. Make sure the code works
2. Get code into production.
3. Think about sustainability.  

This often leads to short-term wins at the cost of long-term pain. **The real starting point should be sustainability.**  Then can you build a system that withstands the test of time instead of burning out under quick fixes and shortcuts.

## The Runner’s Analogy  

Think of Continuous Delivery like becoming a runner:  

- You don’t just run fast on day one.  
- You train, build a routine, and commit to a healthy lifestyle.  
- At first, progress feels slow — but with discipline, you run farther and faster.  

The same applies to software delivery: prioritize sustainable practices first, and speed will follow.

## A Reframed Definition  

If I were to rewrite Jez’s quote to reflect the right order of importance, it would look like this:  

> *"Continuous Delivery is the ability to deliver code into production in a **sustainable**, safe, and fast way — enabling changes of all types, including features, configuration changes, bug fixes, and experiments."*


By flipping the order of priorities, you ensure that **sustainability is the foundation**, not an afterthought.
