title: "The IoT Devices That Saved Me Thousands"

The Internet of Things is here, light bulbs, thermostats, outlets, microwaves, fridges, dishwashers, meat thermometers, grills, and more are now “smart.”  

But here’s the problem: most devices **add complexity** to life instead of making life easier.

With many IoT devices, you end up serving them:  

- Updating firmware on light bulbs ... no thanks.  
- “Smart” thermostat schedules ... an analog schedule works just fine.  
- Wi-Fi cooking thermometer ... I can get up and check an analog one.  
- Smart grill ... [see this Reddit gem about a Thanksgiving Traeger software update](https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/r3o76m/sending_forced_software_updates_to_a_grill_on_a/).  

In addition to the hassle factor, add the **privacy** and **security** concerns, and I generally avoid IoT devices.

## The One IoT Device I Swear By  

There is one exception: my smart **water sensors**.  

The brand I use includes a central hub and individual sensors placed around the house. The companion app can send alerts via email. I set it up so alerts route through my personal **PagerDuty** account, ensuring both my partner and I get notified immediately.  

About a year after installing the sensors, PagerDuty woke us up at **2 a.m.**  

The water hose had failed. My guess is the leak had been running for no more than 5 minutes before the alarm went off.  

In that time, **2 - 4 gallons** of water hit the kitchen floor. Without the alert, we would have woken up to a much bigger disaster.

## Worth Every Penny  

Smart water sensors are the rare IoT device I’ll happily maintain.  

- I’ll update their firmware.  
- I’ll test them.  
- I’ll replace their batteries.  

Because they’ve already paid for themselves and potentially saved us thousands.
