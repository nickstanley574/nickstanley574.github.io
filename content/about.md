Hi. I’m Nick.

My origin story goes back to grade school, when my grandfather brought home an old iMac and AOL dial-up internet. After school, I spent most days at my grandparents’ house exploring the early internet, tinkering with computers, and helping my grandfather experiment with technology. In the summers, I’d tag along with my aunt, who helped manage tech in downtown Chicago, and wander the server rooms in her building. 

Those experiences (mixed with some sci-fi altruism and a desire for adventure) set me on the path I’m on today.

Before my tech career, I worked a handful of unique jobs, from detasseling corn in Illinois to doing campground maintenance in northern Wisconsin. Outside of work, I indulge my love of adventure through travel. I’ve climbed the Dolomites, dived the Great Barrier Reef, hiked The Wave, explored a salt mine in Poland, car-camped in Big Bend, and stayed in a capsule hotel in Tokyo.

When I started my career, I never could have imagined the opportunities ahead or how fast the industry would change, especially with AI accelerating how we create and solve problems. Early on, I was laser-focused on the the technical understanding how systems worked.

Now, after more than a decade in the field, my focus has shifted toward people. I find more fulfillment in mentoring, collaborating, and supporting others to achieve things we couldn’t build alone.

My career is what has allowed me to do the things I love and support the people around me. I’m always looking to learn something new and understand emerging technology. Both to deepen my own knowledge and to keep growing professionally.

While I’ll never fully stop coding or experimenting with technology (I like it too much), I’m committed to continuing to grow as a mentor and manager. I’m grateful for the experiences so far and excited for what’s next.
